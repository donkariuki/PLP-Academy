Â AGILE VS WATERFALL

---

Difference Between Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Approach:
Waterfall follows a sequential and linear process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach where work is divided into small cycles (sprints) with continuous improvements.

Flexibility:
Waterfall is rigid and does not easily accommodate changes once the project starts.
Agile is highly flexible, allowing changes to be made at any stage based on feedback.

Project Phases:
Waterfall consists of fixed stages: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Agile follows a continuous cycle of planning, development, testing, and review, with multiple iterations.

Customer Involvement:
Waterfall involves minimal customer interaction after the initial requirement phase.
Agile encourages frequent customer collaboration throughout the project.

Risk Management:
Waterfall has a higher risk because issues are typically discovered late in the testing phase.
Agile has lower risk as testing is continuous, allowing early detection and resolution of problems.

Delivery:
Waterfall delivers the final product only at the end of the project.
Agile delivers functional components incrementally, providing value early and frequently.

In conclusion:
Best For:
Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as construction or government projects.
Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements and a need for rapid iterations, such as software development or startups.
